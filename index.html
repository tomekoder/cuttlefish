          <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
          <p>A cuttlefish is a type of mollusc in the Sepiina suborder. They are a part of the cephalopods class, which also includes squids, octopuses and nautiluses. There are over 120 species in the Sepiina suborder, the common cuttlefish being the best-known and also one of the largest. These can grow up to 49 centimeters and 4 kilograms in temperate waters, but most specimens only reach about half that size. The cuttlefish has eight arms and two feeder-tentacles that are used to grasp prey.</p>

          <h2>Cuttlebone</h2>
          <p>
            Unique to this species of cephalopods, Cuttlefish have an oval-shaped internal shell called the cuttlebone, composed primarily of aragonite. It is used for buoyancy control as the animal can fill it with gas or liquid at will. Cuttlebones are often washed up at shore as they are the only remains of a dead cuttlefish, and have had various uses to us throughout human history, like being ground up and added to pastes for medical purposes. Today, the calcium-rich shells are often used as a dietary supplement for birds and other pets.

          <h2>Camouflage</h2>
          <p>Cuttlefish possess extraordinary camouflaging abilities, being able to change their skin’s color and pattern as well as use their muscles to change the very texture of the skin. They can quickly change their appearance within just one second. They use this ability to camouflage themselves, scare off potential predators and attract mates. </p>

          <h2>Life cycle</h2>
       
          <p>Cuttlefish typically live for one to two years depending on the species. They start mating at around five months of age. The male cuttlefish will compete for the females during the mating season and are at great advantage if they are the largest specimen. When they’ve acquired a mate they will guard the female from other males. Since the cuttlefish are indeterminate growers, the smaller ones have another chance at mating the next year as they will be bigger by then. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Some smaller males have also exhibited a different but successful technique by utilizing their camouflage to pursue guarded females. They change their colors to imitate a female cuttlefish and even pretend they are holding an egg sack. The male guarding the female will let them swim past and the smaller male can now mate with the female.
